# VRGroupCoursework
Group coursework for Virtual Reality.

This group work is about creating a virtual world and our theme is impossible worlds. You start in the main hub world and you choose which world you wish to explore. Each world is made by a different member of the group. This project was built using unity and every world was created by:

Andrius Maciulis, Beth Quin, Czar Echavez, Daniel Hanna, George Cazacu, James Tang

Check out the releases sections at the top if you wish to play this world (If you don't have Unity installed)

(However we are unable to show the final commit since that commit exceeds the GitHub limit of 100MB)
